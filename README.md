# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

WHAT IT DOES?

Permaculture Design Engine (PDE)

A context-aware, adaptive permaculture layout generator in JavaScript.

PDE generates realistic, non-circular permaculture zones and intelligently places land elements (ponds, orchards, gardens, livestock, swales, etc.) based on ecological principles, terrain, water flow, and human interaction frequency.

🔹 Features

Dynamic functional zoning (Zone 0–5) based on interaction and terrain

Element placement guided by ecological relationships

Hydrology-first design: ponds, swales, and forests placed along water flow

Access optimization with least-cost path algorithms

Modular, extensible architecture for simulation or AI integration

Tech Stack

JavaScript (ES6+)

Canvas / SVG / D3.js for rendering

Turf.js for spatial analysis

d3-contour / marching-squares for contour & swale generation

A* / Dijkstra algorithms for path optimization

Use Cases

Permaculture & agroforestry planning

Ecological land-use modeling

Educational tools for sustainable agriculture

Regenerative farming decision support

Future Roadmap

Seasonal & multi-year simulation

AI-assisted design reasoning & explanations

Regional native species & ecology integration

Human behavior modeling & feedback loops

Collaborative multi-user design

Contribution

Contributions are welcome from developers, ecologists, permaculture designers, and sustainability enthusiasts.
Focus: ecological logic, clarity, and adaptability.
